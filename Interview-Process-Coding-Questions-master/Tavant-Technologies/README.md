## Interview with Senior Technical Architect (Glider discussion):  
1. One Simple Coding question:
   - Given a list of candidates (list of names - there can be a name repeating).Number of times the candidate's name is repeating is his votes. So, find the candidate with maximum number of votes and if there is a tie then print the candidates name which is lexicographically smaller.  
2. Variety of questions from big data projects from the CV involving workflow orchestration,Hive,Hadoop
3. Given a scenario, your knowledge on designing systems is tested aggressively from solutioning approach to implementation.
4. Difference between external and managed tables in hive
5. Questions on CI/CD
6. How would you perform testing (need specifics here!)
7. How would a design a data ingestion framework that consumes datasets from different data sources (Assume each job of data dump from each source is scheduled at a different time), Design a system that consumes the dump with as minimum latency as possible from different sources and makes it available for different applications?
