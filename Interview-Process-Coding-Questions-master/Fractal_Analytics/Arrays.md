Given an array A of size N as an input, return the following:  
  + for every element of array, find the sum of elements upto that element(inclusive):  
  
Examples:  
```
A = [3,5,6,9,10], N = 5
for 3, sum of elements upto 3 is 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.  
for 5, sum of elements upto 5 is 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15.  
for 6, sum of elements upto 6 is 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21.  
for 9, sum of elements upto 9 is 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45.  
for 10, sum of elements upto 10 is 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 55.
