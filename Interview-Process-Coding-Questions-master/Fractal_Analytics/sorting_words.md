Given a sentence, sort the words of a sentence according to the their individual lengths. If one or more words have same length
then sort the words by first character of the word.

```
Example: 
Input: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
Output: dog fox the The lazy over brown jumps quick

```
+ This problem can be extended to sorting the words by second letter in case of collision with first letter and continue
till the end of word and stop when collision is resolved.
