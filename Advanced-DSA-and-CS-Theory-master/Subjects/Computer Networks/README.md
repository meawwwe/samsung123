# Classifications of Computer Networks
  <pre>
  Most widely used models are Open Systems Interconnection and Department of Defense(TCP/IP)
  1. Local Area Network(LAN)
     LAN - Devices
      (i)Wired ( eg: Ethernet - Hub, Switch(Indermediate things)
      (ii)Wireless( eg: Wifi)
  2. Metropolitan Area Network(MAN)
     More than 2 LAN'S connected in particular area
     Devices: Switches/Hub
              Routers/Bridges
  3. Wide Area Network(WAN) - telecommunications networks(large area)
     More than 2 MAN'S connected
  
  <b>A host can acts as a Client when he is requesting information.</b>
  <b>A host can acts as a Server when he provides information.</b>
  <b>A host can also request and provide information(No need of server), which is called Peer.  Not scalable and No centralization</b>
    if 1 peer makes a req, it is possible that multiple peers have copy of that req obj. Now prob is how to get the ip address of all. So It is decided y Architecture of P2P
  
  <b>THREE SUCH ARCHITECTURES PRESENT</b>:
  <b><i> 1. Centralized Directory</i></b>
     1 main server - Contains all details abt requirements and ip address
     Peer - Every peer need to go through server for details
  
  <b>2. Query Flooding</b> - It used Distributed systems

       <b>Gnutella was the frst decentralized Peer-to-Peer Network</b>
       kaZaA technology is such example that makes use of Napster and Gnutella 
  
  <b>3. Exploiting Heterogeneity</b> 
       It like divide and conquer 
       Many Peer connect to super Node
       All super nodes connect to each other

# Layering in Networks
  <pre>
  <p>
  1. OSI Reference Model
     Open System Interconnection - Vertical approach
     The purpose of the model is how to faciliate communication between systems(like windows to linux or any)
     It is never fully Implemented
     
     7 layers in OSI Reference model(order is imp)
	     <b>7. Application</b> (It can send any size of data to TCP, no limit)
	          Enables the user to access the network resources
	          Protocols:
	          <b>1. Telnet</b>: Used for managing files in the internet, Port num is 23
	          <b>2. FTP</b>   : FTP is not just a protocol but it is also a program, Port num is 20 for data connection, 21 for control connection
	            2 TCP connections used by FTP in parallel(data, control)
	            FTP need to keep track of state through the session(past clients info)
	            Type of band used is Out of Band
	            
	          <b>3. TFTP</b>   : If we know exactly and where to find(simplified version of FTP), Port num is 69
	                      It used UDP as a Transport Layer Protocol
	          4. NFS    : Port num is 2049
	          5. SMTP   : Port num is 25, It uses Out of Band
	             
	             All FTP, HTTP(In Band), SMTP Uses TCP as a underlying protocol
	             GET ->----------<-
	             SMTP            POP/IMAP
	      Out gng mail services  Post Office protocol(used to retrive mails from server)
	(transfers from servers to   Internet Message Access Protocol
	  servers)
	                             
	             SMTP model is 2 types
	             (i)End-to-End method(Communicate btw 2 different organizations)
	             (ii)Store and Forward(Communicate within organizations)
	             
	             Client---->User_Agent------>queue----->MTA--

	          6. DNS    : Port num is 53
	          
	         <b>Why does DNS use UDP and not TCP ?</b>
       	          UDP is much faster. TCP is slow and requires 3-way handshake. DNS server don't have to keep connections and these requests r fit into UDP segments.
	          DNS Uses Cache to work efficiently, not using nslookup over and over again
	          DNS Spoofing is like finding flaws in DNS change the ip address redirect to malicious
	          <b>PREVENT FROM DNS SPOOFING</b>: DNS Security Extensions(DNSSEC)add an additional layer to prevent spoofing

	         
	     <b>6. Presentation</b>
	          Concered with syntax and semantics(mng) info which is exchanged
	          Services:
	          Translation, Encryption, Compression
	     <b>5. Session</b>
	          Maintains and synchronizes the interaction
	          Services:
	          Dialog Control, Synchronization
	     <b>4. Transport</b>(imp)
	          TCP and UDP	
	          Process to process delivery of entire message
	          Services:
	          Port addressing, Segmentation and Reassembly(spliting and combining data), Conntection and End-to-End flow control

                   for 1st packet we have TCP layer
                   for 2nd packet(ack) we have both TCP and APPLICATION LAYER
                   
                 <b>TCP Implementation uses 4 timers:</b>
                 1. ReTransmission Timer:
                    To retransmit lost segments, TCP uses (RTO)- Round-Trip Time(RTT)
                    
                 <b>RTT 3 types</b>
                 (i)Measured RTT(RTTm): Time req for the segement to reach the destination and be acknowledged
                 (ii)Smoothed RTT(RTTs): It is weighted avg of RTT
                 	After frst measurement -> RTTs = RTTm
                 	After each measurement -> RTTs = (1-t)*RTTs + t*RTTm
                 	<b>Note</b>: Default value is 1/8(not given)
                 (iii)Deviated RTT(RTTd): Most implementations don't use RTT alone so RTT derivated is also calculated to findout RTO
                       After frst measurement -> RTTd = RTTm/2
                       After each measurement -> RTTd = (1-k)*RTTd + k*(RTTm - RTTs)
                       **Note**: Default value is 1/4(not given)
                       
                 2. Persistent Timer:(Imp)
                    To deal with 0 window size deadlock situation, TCP uses this timer(It start when size is 0). When this timer goes off, the sending tcp sends a special segment called a probe(contains 1 byte of new data has a seq num, but it seq num is never acknowledged. The probe causes the receiving TCP to resend the acknowledged which was lost
                    
                 3. Keep Alive Timer:
                    Prevent a long idle connection between 2 TCP's. The time out is usally 2 hrs after client response at all the time. No response after 2 hrs it sends a probe segment. It send 10 probes each of which 75sec apart, then it terminates.
                 
                 4. Time wait Timer:
                    The timer starts after sending the last Ack for 2nd FIN and closing the connection.
                    
                  <b>TCP Connection Termination</b>:
                    The common way of terminating a TCP connection is using a TCP's headers FIN flag(1 side termination)
                    RST Flag used for both sides termination
                    PSH Flag: 
                    	Generally Transport layer waits some time for the application layer to send data of max size, to reduce the packets
                    	numbers, this process can't be implemented in chat systems, so at that time we use PSH Flag. Data is delivered in sequence.
                    	eg: infinite loop break
                    	
                    URG Flag:
                    	It is used for sending the details frst compared to other flags, simply priority. Data is delivered out of sequence
                    
                  <b>WrapAround Concept</b>: 
                  When sequence numbers(TCP header's contains 2^32 = 4gb) are over, it resue the same seq numbers. seq numbers are created while intiall connection
                  
                  WrapAround Time depends on the seq numbers bandwidth (tot seq nums / Bandwidth)
                  
                  
                  <b>User Datagram Protocol</b>:
                   UDP is more efficient in terms of latency(measure of delay) and bandwidth
                   UDP header is 8 bytes fixed and simple header, while for TCP it may vary from 20 to 60 bytes
                   Unlike TCP, the checksum calculation is not mandatory in UDP. <b>UDP depends on IP and ICMP for reporting.</b>
                   UDP is stateless, connectionless, unreliable and message oriented protocol, useful for Boardcast and Unidrectional communication		
                   No fields are there in UDP to control flow or Congestion(A state occurs in the network layer when the message traffic is so heavy)
                   
                   <b>Congestion policy in TCP</b>:(Imp)
                     1. Slow Start Phase: exponential increment(After every RTT the congestion window size incr exponentailly)
                     2. Congestion Avoidance Phase: additive increment
                     3. Congestion Detection Phase: multiplicative decrement
                     
                     ReTransmission can occur in one of 2 cases
                     (i) When the RTO Timer Times Out
                    (ii) When 3 duplicate ACK's are received

# Types of Network Topology (Layout)
  <pre>
  <p>
   1. Bus
       Data is transmitted over common transmission medium
       No security
            A
            |      |      |
            |      |      |
            |      |      |    Terminator
      ----------------------------
                |      |
                |      |
                |      |
                       B
       
   2. Ring (Unidirectional)
       It is a BUS Topology in a closed loop, Peer-to-Peer LAN 
       Sending and receiving data takes place with the help of a Token(Token is circulated through out the network)
       No Security
       
   3. Star
       Every node is connected to a central node called "hub or switch". It is centralized
       
       
                     \     |      /
                      \    |     /
                       \   |    /

                       /    |
                            |
                            
         Two or more stars can be connected through repeaters
   
   4. Mesh
       Each Node is directly connected to every other nodes in the network(Issues with broadcasting messages)
   5. Hybrid
       Combinations of 1 or more topologies
   </p>

# NOTE:

  <p>
  Parity bits/check bits used for error detection
  1. Tele-communication - Baud rate(speed)
  2. Loop back IP address btw 127.0.0.1 to 127.255.255.255
  3. If the system is used seperate protocols gateway is used
  4. https = http + cryptographic protocols
     http(state less protocol - server doesn't maintains info abt past clients) - Works at Application Layer (doesn't require certification)
     By using cookies(collecting user searching info data in simple terms) we can make http(stateless to) stateform(https)
     https - Works at Transport Layer(require certificates)
  5. Isochronous - STAR-STOP mode or CHARACTER mode
  6. TCP RESET (RST) - Branching to frequently used subroutines
  7. Multiplexing and Demultiplexing definitions
  8. Packets of the same session may be routed through diff paths is both TCP and UDP
     With the help of TCP window -> Flow control
     With the help of congestion windows -> Congestion control
  9. Uploading from input
     POST method:
     URL method:
     	uses GET method(limitations of size 256,)
 10. Caching mechanism can't be appiled for dynamic sites only for static sites
     Proxy server(acts as both client and server - webcaching reduce response time for client req)
 11. Interface - connection between host and physical link

    Sending packets(consists of [data|source address|destination] address) from 1 host to another is called casting. It is 2 types
     1. Unicast(1-1)         _ _ _ _ Limited
     2. Boardcast(1-many)---|_ _ _ _ 
                                     Directed
                             
         1. Limited: within the same network, 1 host want to send many hosts (by using limited if you send 1host it will reach to entire hosts by: [data|source code|255.255.255.255|]
          
         2. Directed: sending 1 packet to many hosts in diff network([data|source address|NID.255.255.255])

   SubNeting: Dividing a big network into small network(4 steps required to reach process but adv is more
   Subnet Mask: It is a 32bit number
                No.of 1's represent : what is NID part and SID part
                No.of 0's represent : what is HID
                
          Using subnet mask we can find the where IP address network belongs to(SM & IP = NID)
          
          
        CIDR(Class less Inter domain Routing) | subnet masking | wildcard mask | no.of ip address
    
    
    
   In a network if subnet size is different then it is called Variable Length Subnet Masking(VLSM)
     Given a subnet mask, no.of zeros represent the size of network 
     
   There are some points which should be kept in mind while supernetting: 
	All the Networks should be contiguous. 
	The block size of every network should be equal and must be in form of 2^n. 
	First Network id should be exactly divisible by whole size of supernet.(When a binary number is divisible by 2^n , then last n bits are equal to 0)

# GATE OVERVIEW CONCEPTS:
	1. Number of subnets : Given bits for mask â€“ No. of bits in default mask
	2. Subnet address : AND result of subnet mask and the given IP address
	3. Broadcast address : By putting the host bits as 1 and retaining the network bits as in the IP address
	4. Number of hosts per subnet : 2^(32 â€“ Given bits for mask) â€“ 2
	5. First Host ID : Subnet address + 1 (adding one to the binary representation of the subnet address)
	6. Last Host ID : Subnet address + Number of Hosts
	7. How to calculate IP address subent info ?
		NID: floor(Host address / Subnet no.of hosts) * Subnet no.of hosts
		BID: (Host ID + Subnet no.of hosts - 1)
		First Host: NID + 1
		Last Host: BID - 1
  		Tip: Based on Network prefix subnet no.of hosts depends
  		eg: 192.168.1.65/28   - 2 ^ (32-28) = subnet no.of hosts
