# Checking
 <pre>
 <b>Array and integers</b>
 while arthemetic operators check abt constraints
 if numbers check +ve, -ve, 0 and size_limit
 for solving problems check the case of <b>Integers values limit, duplicates(check need to avoid or include case)</b>
   
 <b>Strings</b>
 check about the what kind of chars it involved and size, any leading or trailing spaces
 </pre>
   	
# Approach
  <pre>
  Frst implement the base case or check it is working for that like size = 0 or size = 1
